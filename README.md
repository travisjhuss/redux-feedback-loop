# Feedback Loop with Redux #


Use query text from data.sql to set up database and table as well as included dummy data.

## Description

This is a simple feedback loop to be used to check in on current students. As the form is filled out, the data is saved in a redux store and then sent to the database. On the admin page, someone can check the database and see all previous feedback, flag a post, or delete a post. Styling was done with Material UI. 

This assignment was pretty straightforward and I didn't encounter too many issues. I used most of my time with this assignment to continue to learn and explore MUI. I played around with the themeProvider a little and am starting to learn how to style more within MUI and not rely on over-riding with CSS. I feel like my code is a little hacky in that department but am thrilled to bring to life my ideas and learn better ways to do it along the way.
